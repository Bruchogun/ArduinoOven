# ArduinoOven

This is an Arduino controlled conveyor oven, with semi-independent burners at the top and bottom with their own thermocouple, it's semi-independent because bottom burner affects top.
This design sacrifices control to get a simpler design compared to those convection based oven.

We use 3 PID controls, two for the top and bottom burners and the third is for the conveyor. It's possibly and overkill but it works!.
